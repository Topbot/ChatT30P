- In AdsPower RPA Plus dialog automation, after clicking OK, the confirmation wait should be 1 minute (not 20 seconds).
- In the ChatT30P project, use AdsPower for managing browser profiles to automate logins for Telegram, WhatsApp, and Max. Ensure that the AdsPower URL is accessible from the server where the application is running (do not use localhost if the application is on a remote server). Configuration settings for AdsPower are located in Web.config (BaseUrl, Token).
